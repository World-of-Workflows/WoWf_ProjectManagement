# Project Management solution for World of Workflows

We will create a workflow solution for project management.
World of Workflows will provide the backbone for this state-of-the-art project management solution.

Using Workflows will allow AI to integrate with your projects, so the mundane tasks of managing projects - eg getting the status, notifying stakeholders - can be automated, allowing you, the project manager to focus on what your team members are supposed to be doing, and removing road blocks.

## Step 1: Outlining the Features
Resource Allocation: A module to assign resources (personnel, equipment, etc.) to various tasks.
Gantt Chart Timeline: Visual representation of project timeline, showing task durations, dependencies, and progress.
## Step 2: Pseudocode for the Project Management Website
Front-End (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

Create the layout with HTML.
Style with CSS for a user-friendly interface.
Implement interactive components (forms, buttons) using JavaScript.
Resource Allocation Module

Input form for resources (name, type, availability).
Script to assign resources to tasks.
Display assignments on the website.
Gantt Chart Module

Script to create a Gantt chart based on task data (start date, end date, dependencies).
Use a JavaScript library like Google Charts for Gantt chart visualization.
Interactive chart to update tasks and view progress.
Back-End (Optional, depending on complexity)

Server-side logic to manage data.
Database to store project and resource information.
APIs for front-end to fetch and update data.
## Step 3: Implementing the Code
I will write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the website.
For the Gantt chart, I'll use a JavaScript library for ease and efficiency.


## Resource Allocation Module

Simple forms might not be sufficient for complex resource management. Implement advanced features like drag-and-drop for resource assignment and a calendar view for availability.
## Gantt Chart Module

Depending solely on a library might limit customization. Extend the basic library functionalities with custom JavaScript to allow more interactivity like click-to-edit on the chart.

## Responsive design
Ensure that the design is mobile-friendly with touch gestures for navigation and interaction, especially important for the Gantt chart.
